Hello, 

We are Ben Jabria Adem and Valentin Charles, we're 21 ans 20 years old
and we decided to do this project for many reasons.
Firstly, we are passionated by the development domain, so learning
a new language and make a game were more than a choice to us, we were
designed to do it.
Secondly, we've developped many games together during projects, driven by
school or by us, so the duo for the projet formed itself instantly as soon
as we were aware of this tournament.
Thirdly, we're great competitors and we love to try to be the best in a domain
especially when this one passionates us.
During this project, we learned so much on BabylonJs et even on
development, it made us improve a lot in both ways and that's what
we were expecting starting this project so we're satisfied on the
outcome, whatever the price is.
Considering we were clearly ambitious about this project, we spent a lot of time on the design, compared to our last projects, in particular in Blender, in which we spent months building the map by ourselves.
We also carefully choosed which sprites, models and sounds we were going to use like the weapons, the hands of the principal character and the enemies.
Adding to that, we started the project by actually thinking to a story that would lead us on our future choices in the developments
(which is by the way in the "Lettre_explication.pdf").

What about the game and how is it played ?
²²
It's a FPS survival in which u must have a good aim to survive,
in fact, you have infinite ammo and the rounds goes as far as you
can reach. you first start with a pistol the first rounds, and then, we'll you'll discover it by youself ! I don't wanna spoil you :)
But a really important advise is to start the game in easy mode,
because once the monsters reach you, you must spam S to escape, but
that's considering you're lucky enough to survive.
The bullets that hit the enemies stuns them for one second, and you'll have to plar around that, that is basically hit and run.
Your life and the ammo are displayed on the bottom right, but we didn't want them to be too big to appreciate the beauty of this map.
One last thing, is to must follow the advices displayed in the keycode cheatsheet. Good luck to you fellow gamers !

Now to talk furthermore into the code, we used the sprites, models, map... as a basis to implement our code around, and obviously, in that much time of coding, we met errors to a point we could'nt count them anymore, and thankfully, because this is what allowed us to improve.
We decided, since now we've grown up as much in our mentality as in our cleverness, to make a code really cleaner than our old projects
and even if may have cost us a lot of time, we're far from regretting it.
So we implemented concepts such a the hierarchy for the monsters (you can also see their informations in the "Monstres_explication.pdf"), or the accurate visibilty for each of our attributes and functions.
There are still things that we done and that we didn't keep at the end but overall on the clarity part of the code we're also pretty satisfied.
The game to condlude is kind of a resume of what we like to play on games, but as you can probably notice by the name of the version lastly pushed as shown on the src folder, it's still an aplha and we
of cours plan to continue developing on this game after the tournament and even with the traineeship that we started, we try to be as active as possible to advance it at to reach our goal.
Which is the commercialize it in the future.
Thank you for reading all of that if you did so and I hope you will enjoy our creation !
